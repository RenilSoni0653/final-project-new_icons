## Leaning curve and challenges

- In porject task list, we have to start working on our project.So, as a group we gathered some information from the internet and started working on individual tasks.
- After managing the material on a website, the next challenge is to make the appropriate responsive and attractive layout of our website so that we can stand out in our class. It was bit challenging to do padding, margin, do some research and add some effects. However, I worked hard and had done lot of effort to make every page in this project.
- While implementing JavaScript in project, I was difficult to implement in the project as we have to validate each and every entry with accurate information
- In addition to that, We have to coordinate with CSS and HTML to display error messages in proper manner.
- Considering more advance from above, I've added JavaScript validation to all forms whenever user enters submit button without entering data into the form.
- In addition to that, when browser window becomes smaller like mobile all the links are resides in sidebar which only be enable in mobile view.
- Furthermore, I've added jQuery for dyanmic data viewing in tables.
