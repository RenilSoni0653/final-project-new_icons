## Leaning curve and challenges

- In porject task list, we have to start working on our project.So, as a group we gathered some information from the internet and started working on individual tasks.
- After managing the material on a website, the next challenge is to make the appropriate responsive and attractive layout of our website so that we can stand out in our class. It was bit challenging to do padding, margin, do some research and add some effects. However, I worked hard and had done lot of effort to make every page in this project.
- While implementing JavaScript in project, I was difficult to implement in the project as we have to validate each and every entry with accurate information
- In addition to that, We have to coordinate with CSS and HTML to display error messages in proper manner.
- Considering more advance from above, I've added JavaScript validation to all forms whenever user enters submit button without entering data into the form.
- In addition to that, when browser window becomes smaller like mobile all the links are resides in sidebar which only be enable in mobile view.
- Furthermore, I've added jQuery for dyanmic data viewing in tables.

## Leaning curve and challenges

- In the project I have learnt a lot of new things and the majorly it is to make the data have dynamicity. I have achieved it in two pages: Planning and Scheduing , Project Roadmap 
- In the beginning I took help from the internet onto how to achive the dynamicity of data and how to use the JavaScript functionalities so as to achive the desired working of the pages.
- In the Planning and Scheduling page I learnt to pass the values to the Dynamic Charts that I have created to display the portion completed of the task and that it has the animatiom which is achived using CSS. Therefore, it was really useful for me to get to know how it is done by integrating HTML, JavaScript and CSS
- In the LogBook page I got to learn how to dynamically update the data contained inside of the Logbook, which is fetched from the form that contains all the fields that a user has to fill so as to update the prior logbook. I also got to learn about the onclick events and how to call specific functions so as to bring specificity of the desired taks.
- In the Project Roadmap page I learnt how to use JQuery, data table, Google Visualisation so as to dynamically display the timeline of the entire project onto the year-timeline. In this page I also learnt how to make progress bars, both dynamic and static so as to print the progression that the tasks have come upto. I also got to understand how do we use the array of arrays so as to populate the data into the project-timeline graph.
